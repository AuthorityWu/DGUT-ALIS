abstract: In this paper, we have proposed a fingerprint orientation model based on 2D Fourier expansions (FOMFE) in the phase plane. The FOMFE does not require prior knowledge of singular points (SPs). It is able to describe the overall ridge topology seamlessly, including the SP regions, even for noisy fingerprints. Our statistical experiments on a public database show that the proposed FOMFE can significantly improve the accuracy of fingerprint feature extraction and thus that of fingerprint matching. Moreover, the FOMFE has a low-computational cost and can work very efficiently on large fingerprint databases. The FOMFE provides a comprehensive description for orientation features, which has enabled its beneficial use in feature-related applications such as fingerprint indexing. Unlike most indexing schemes using raw orientation data, we exploit FOMFE model coefficients to generate the feature vector. Our indexing experiments show remarkable results using different fingerprint databases.
