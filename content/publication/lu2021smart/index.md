abstract: Deep hashing based retrieval models have been widely used in large-scale image retrieval systems. Recently, there has been a surging interest in studying the adversarial attack problem in deep hashing based retrieval models. However, the effectiveness of existing adversarial attacks is limited by their poor perturbation management, unawareness of ranking weight, and only laser-focusing on the attack image. These shortages lead to high perturbation costs yet low AP reductions. To overcome these shortages, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework to improve the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. Our attack designs a dimension-wise surrogate Hamming distance function to help with wiser perturbation management. Further, in generating adversarial examples, instead of focusing on a single image, we propose to collectively incorporate relevant images combined with an AP-oriented (average precision) weight function. In addition, our attack can deal with both untargeted and targeted adversarial attacks in a flexible manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with the same attack performance, our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in perturbation cost on both untargeted and targeted attack tasks.
