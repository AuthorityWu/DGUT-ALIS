abstract: 'Summary: 
1. A critical property of count data is its mean–variance relationship, yet this is rarely considered inmultivariate analysis in ecology. 
2. This study considers what is being implicitly assumed about the mean–variance relationship indistance-based analyses – multivariate analyses based on a matrix of pairwise distances – and whatthe eﬀect is of any misspeciﬁcation of the mean–variance relationship. 
3. It is shown that distance-based analyses make implicit assumptions that are typically out-of-stepwith what is observed in real data, which has major consequences. 
4. Potential consequences of this mean–variance misspeciﬁcation are: confounding location anddispersion eﬀects in ordinations; misleading results when trying to identify taxa in which an eﬀect isexpressed; failure to detect a multivariate eﬀect unless it is expressed in high-variance taxa. 
5. Data transformation does not solve the problem. 
6. A solution is to use generalised linear models and their recent multivariate generalisations, whichis shown here to have desirable properties.'
