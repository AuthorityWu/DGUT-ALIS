abstract: Pattern recognition is an essential part of modern security systems for malware detection, intrusion detection, and spam filtering. Conventional classifiers widely used in these applications are found vulnerable themselves to adversarial machine learning attacks. Existing studies argued that ensemble classifiers are more robust than a single classifier under evasion attacks due to more uniform weights produced on the basis of training data. In this paper, we investigate the problem in a more practical setting where attackers do not know the classifier details. Instead, attackers may acquire only a portion of the labeled data or a replacement dataset for learning the target decision boundary. In this case, we show that ensemble classifiers are not necessarily more robust under a least effort attack based on gradient descent. Our experiments are conducted with both linear and kernel SVMs on real datasets for spam filtering and malware detection.
